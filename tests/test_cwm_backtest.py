"""Tests for the CodeWorldModel backtest instrument.

Weighted deliberately toward `arc3_cwm.extract`. Every prior data-pipeline
bug in this project was silent -- the `action_input` bug made every
recorded action look like RESET and invalidated four stages of results
before anyone noticed, and a stale checkpoint sat in `checkpoints/` for
weeks. A backtest whose extractor is subtly wrong produces a confident,
plausible, entirely meaningless number, which is worse than no number.

Grids here are small (4x4, 3x3) rather than the real 64x64. Nothing in
the extractor, renderer, oracle or replay path assumes a size, and the
one place that could (`_is_grid`) is tested for rectangularity directly.
