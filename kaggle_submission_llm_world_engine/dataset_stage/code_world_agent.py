"""LLM world-engine agent (plan.md Stages 1-3): draft an executable
per-game world model from an opening-probe transcript, validate it by
replaying the transcript through it, plan actions by searching over the
model (no LLM calls per step), and repair it online when a real
observation diverges from its prediction.

Two LLM roles, two models, both invoked rarely (see architecture.md's
"Two LLM roles" section):
  - "coder" (default: Qwen3-Coder) drafts/repairs WorldModel source --
    events, not every step.
  - "action_head" (default: Gemma) is a sparse fallback consulted only
    when the non-LLM planner stalls (llm_engine.planner.PlanResult.stalled)
    -- it suggests a single action using broader gameplay/visual judgment
    when search has nothing to go on, then control returns to search.

The moment-to-moment default is always the LLM-free beam search in
llm_engine/planner.py -- that's the efficiency lever, unchanged by adding
the action-head fallback.

See ../../../architecture.md and ../../../plan.md for the full design.
This file is intentionally thin -- it's glue between the competition's
Agent interface and the llm_engine/ package, which holds all the actual
logic and has no dependency on this framework.
