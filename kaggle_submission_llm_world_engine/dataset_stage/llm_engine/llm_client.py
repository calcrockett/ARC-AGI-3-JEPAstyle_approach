"""Clients for the two LLM roles (see architecture.md's "Two LLM roles"):
  - "coder": drafts/repairs WorldModel source. Wants a strong coding model
    (Qwen3-Coder), called on draft/repair events only -- see drafting.py.
  - "action_head": a sparse fallback that suggests a single next action
    when the non-LLM planner genuinely stalls (see planner.py's
    PlanResult.stalled and code_world_agent.py's fallback wiring). Wants a
    model with broad gameplay/visual judgment (Gemma) more than raw coding
    strength, and is called far less often than "coder".

Two backends, selected via LLM_BACKEND (default "openai"):
  - "openai": an ordinary OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint
    (e.g. vLLM/SGLang serving on the RTX Pro 6000). Right backend if you
    can actually get vLLM running -- continuous batching across the
    Swarm's concurrent games, real HTTP isolation between roles.
  - "transformers": loads a model in-process via plain `transformers` +
    `torch` and calls `.generate()` directly, no server at all. This is
    what actually runs in the real competition submission environment as
    currently built: with `enable_internet: false` (required for a real
    scored run), pip installing vLLM isn't possible and it isn't
    preinstalled -- confirmed empirically against a real no-internet,
    competition-attached Kaggle kernel, where only `transformers` and
    `torch` were already present. Swapping backends is a config change
    (LLM_BACKEND env var), not a code change.

Also provides a MockLLMClient with no model behind it at all, used for
local development/smoke-testing this project's plumbing on a machine
without the target GPU. It is NOT a substitute for a real model and should
never be used for an actual submission -- see `make_client`.
