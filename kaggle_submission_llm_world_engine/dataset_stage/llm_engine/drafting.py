_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are writing a Python simulator for one level of an unfamiliar \
grid-based game. You will be shown a transcript of actions taken and what happened. \
Infer the general RULE behind each observed change, not the specific numbers in the \
examples -- your code will be tested against the same transcript and must reproduce \
it exactly, but it should express a rule that plausibly generalizes.

Grids are lists of layers; each layer is a 64x64 list of integers 0-15 (colors). Most \
games use exactly one layer. Coordinates are (x, y), 0-indexed, origin top-left.

Actions: ACTION1-ACTION5 and ACTION7 take no arguments. ACTION6 takes (x, y). What \
each action actually does is game-specific and only knowable from the transcript.

Your code runs with NO imports available (no `import` statements at all -- write \
plain Python using only builtins like list/dict/range/len/enumerate/min/max/abs). \
Do not use numpy, copy, math, or any other module.

Respond with ONLY a single Python code fence containing a `WorldModel` class with \
this exact interface, nothing else:

```python
class WorldModel:
    def __init__(self):
        ...  # hidden state, e.g. self.counters = {}, if you infer the game tracks one

    def predict(self, state, action_name, x=None, y=None):
        # Return (next_state, levels_delta, done)
        ...

    def goal_hint(self, state):
        # float: higher = closer to a win condition (see below)
        ...
```

goal_hint is not decoration -- it is what the agent PLAYS with. Once your model \
is accepted, a search tries each action in your simulator and picks the one whose \
predicted next board has the HIGHEST goal_hint. predict() has to be right; \
goal_hint() has to be useful. So:

  - goal_hint must NOT be constant, and it must tell ACTIONS apart: it is checked \
by predicting where each action leads from boards in the transcript, and if it \
scores every pair of different outcomes the same, your model is rejected however \
good predict() is -- the search would have nothing to choose between.
  - Do NOT score a step counter, timer, or bar/strip along the edge of the board. \
Those change on every step, but the same way whatever action you take, so they \
cannot guide the search. Score the part of the board your actions change \
DIFFERENTLY.
  - If your actions MOVE things, do not just count colours: a moved object has \
exactly the same colour counts, so every move scores the same. Measure positions \
-- e.g. minus the distance from the object you move to where it seems to need to go.
  - Only the ORDER of its values matters, never the scale. A raw count, a negative \
distance or a sum are all fine; there is no need to normalise.
  - Make it reward progress toward what you think the win condition is: for example \
minus the distance from the thing the actions move to a target it seems to be \
heading for, the number of cells already matching a pattern that looks like a goal, \
or minus the number of objects left to clear. If the transcript shows \
levels_completed increasing, the board just before that step is your best evidence \
of what winning looks like.
