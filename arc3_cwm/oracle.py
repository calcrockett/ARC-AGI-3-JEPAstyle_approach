"""A guaranteed-passing WorldModel, generated from a segment.

This is the backtest's **positive control**, and it exists for one
reason: a 0% pass rate is uninterpretable unless the instrument is known
to be able to report a pass at all. Without this, "the model never
produced a replay-passing world model" and "the harness cannot recognise
one" look identical in the output. This repo has been burned by exactly
that shape of ambiguity before -- a benchmark harness that reported a
healthy vLLM server as dead and produced a complete, plausible-looking,
entirely empty results table (CLAUDE.md, the `delta.reasoning` gotcha).

The generated model is a **lookup table, not an inference**. It keys a
fingerprint of (state, action) to the exact cell changes observed, so it
reproduces the transcript by memorisation. That is precisely what the
drafting prompt forbids a real answer from doing. It is useful only as a
wiring check on replay, the sandbox, and the scoring path -- never as
evidence that the task is learnable, and it is never offered to a model
as an example.
