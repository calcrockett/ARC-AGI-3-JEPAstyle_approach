"""The backtest itself: can this model write a world model that replays?

The question this instrument answers, and nothing wider:

    Given the first N observed steps of one real level, can the served
    model write a `WorldModel` whose `predict()` reproduces all N exactly?

That is a **counted** quantity. It has no score variance, no hidden-set
sampling, and no dependence on the +/-2.46 SE that makes a single free
public-25 run unable to rank anything (CLAUDE.md, "THE MEASUREMENT RULE
THAT MATTERS MOST"). A run of this backtest either produces a
replay-passing model for a given segment or it does not.

Two design choices worth stating plainly, because they set what a result
here does and does not license:

**Replay is teacher-forced, not free-running.** `llm_engine.replay`
scores every step from that step's own real `frame_before`, never from
the model's own previous prediction. Errors therefore cannot compound.
This is a strictly *easier* test than the closed-loop rollout a planner
would actually need, which is deliberate: it is meant to be a floor. A
model that fails here cannot possibly support beam search over imagined
futures, so a negative result is decisive. A positive result is
necessary, not sufficient.

**The identity baseline is always reported.** `WORLD_MODEL_SKELETON` is
an "assume nothing ever changes" model; on a step where the board did not
change it passes for free. Real segments here run 0.56-1.00 changed
fraction, so that baseline is not zero and a pass rate quoted without it
would be unreadable. This repo has made exactly that mistake before, at
length, in Stage 1 -- the whole `changed-patches` metric exists because
whole-grid MSE was trivially beatable by predicting no change.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are writing a Python simulator for one level of an \
unfamiliar grid-based game. You will be shown the level's opening grid and a \
list of steps: the action taken and exactly which cells changed. Infer the \
general RULE behind those changes, not the specific numbers -- your code is \
replayed against those same steps and must reproduce every one exactly.

Grids are lists of layers; each layer is a 64x64 list of integers 0-15 \
(colors). These games use exactly one layer. Coordinates are (x, y), \
0-indexed, origin top-left, so cell (x,y) is row y, column x.

Actions: ACTION1-ACTION5 and ACTION7 take no arguments. ACTION6 takes (x, y). \
What each action does is game-specific and only knowable from the steps shown.

Your code runs with NO imports available (no `import` statements at all -- \
plain Python using only builtins like list/dict/range/len/enumerate/min/max/abs). \
Do not use numpy, copy, or math.

THE RETURN CONTRACT -- get this exactly right or the answer is discarded \
before your rule is even considered:

  predict() MUST return a 3-tuple  (next_state, levels_delta, done)
    next_state   a LIST OF LAYERS, same shape as `state`.
                 `state` is [layer]; you must return [new_layer].
                 Returning `new_layer` on its own is WRONG and is the
                 single most common way these answers fail.
    levels_delta an int, almost always 0
    done         a bool, almost always False

Work on a copy. Never mutate `state` in place.

goal_hint is what the agent PLAYS with. Once a model is accepted, a search \
tries each action in your simulator and picks the one whose predicted next \
board has the HIGHEST goal_hint. It must NOT be constant -- a constant gives \
the search nothing to choose between, and a model whose goal_hint returns \
the same value on every board shown is rejected however good predict() is. \
Only the ORDER of its values matters, never the scale: a raw count or a \
negative distance is fine, there is no need to normalise. Make it reward \
progress toward what you think the win condition is.

Here is a COMPLETE, VALID answer. Copy this structure exactly and replace \
BOTH marked sections -- the rule in predict() and the progress measure in \
goal_hint():

```python
class WorldModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.counters = {}

    def predict(self, state, action_name, x=None, y=None):
        layer = [row[:] for row in state[0]]      # copy, never mutate state

        # ---- your inferred rule goes here, editing `layer` in place ----
        # e.g.  if action_name == "ACTION3": layer[y][x] = 5

        return [layer], 0, False                  # NOTE: [layer], not layer

    def goal_hint(self, state):
        layer = state[0]
        # ---- your progress measure goes here: higher = closer to winning ----
        # e.g.  return -(abs(px - tx) + abs(py - ty))   # distance to a target
        return sum(1 for row in layer for c in row if c == 5)   # REPLACE THIS
```

Before you answer, check your own code:
  1. does `predict` return `[layer], 0, False` -- a list, an int, a bool?
  2. is every index inside 0..63, guarded so no IndexError is possible?
  3. does it run without `import`?
  4. is the class complete, with both `predict` and `goal_hint`?
  5. does `goal_hint` give DIFFERENT values to boards that are closer to
     and further from winning -- is it anything but a constant?

class. No prose before or after it.
