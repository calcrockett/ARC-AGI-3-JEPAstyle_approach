"""Build the free CodeWorldAgent prototype kernel.

The prior live test (2026-09-09) ran CodeWorldAgent with
`LLM_BACKEND=transformers` against **Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B** and concluded
0/25 replay passes. Two things have changed since, and both need a fresh
run rather than an argument:

  1. The served model is now **Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4** behind in-kernel
     vLLM -- a different model on a much faster path. The 2026-09-22
     backtest showed that model *can* write a replay-passing world model
     and that with reasoning disabled its candidates actually load and
     run, which the 30B coder's never did.
  2. The per-level transcript reset now exists. Before it, clearing one
     level made the replay gate permanently unsatisfiable for the rest of
     that game, so the prior test never measured a game past its first
     level fairly.

This kernel therefore = the anim notebook's serving cells (which boot
vLLM) + the existing diag driver, repointed at that server. It plays real
games and costs no submission quota.
